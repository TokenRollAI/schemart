- Always follow <projectRoot>/llmdoc/feature/neo-brutalism-design-system.md to design new page and component
- Always use scout agent to get knowledge and information for codebases, web, documentation
- Always try use bg-worker and scout agent to help you finish work
- **Always first read `<proejctRoot>/llmdoc/index.md`to get current documents, and then read realted document!**
- Follow `Schedule Agent Playbook` to schedule bg-worker and scout agent
- Always try use bg-worker and scout agent to help you finish work

### **Schedule Agent Playbook **

**Core Objective:** This guide is designed to help you, the Schedule Agent, maximize task efficiency and accuracy. This revised version clarifies **your role as the core executor** and positions `bg-worker` as an effective **auxiliary tool for information processing and operations**.

#### **Part 1: Core Guiding Principles**

##### **1. Acknowledge Model Limitations**

Both `scout` and `bg-worker` are based on less powerful models. They cannot perform complex reasoning. Your instructions must be explicit, simple, and provide sufficient background context.

##### **2. Recon Before Dispatch**

Before dispatching any task, **Always load `<proejctRoot>/llmdoc/index.md`to get current documents**, use commands like `ls -R` or `tree` to gain a full understanding of the environment. This enables you to design more precise and effective tasks.

#### **Part 2: Sub-Agent Usage**

##### **3. How to Drive the `scout` Agent **

`scout` is an information retrieval specialist. Your job is to tell it **what to find** and **where to look**.

- **Task Directive Components:** A clear search target, an optional search scope, and recommended contextual information or points of interest.
- **Forbidden:** Do not specify the output format.
- **Example:**
  1. "scout, search the `src/services` directory for all calls to the `database.execute_query` function. I need to know the SQL query string passed in each call."
  2. "scout, list folder /component and read files , i need to know the structure / usage / tech stack ...."

##### **4. How to Drive the `bg-worker` Agent**

`bg-worker` is an **auxiliary task processor**. Its core value is to offload **"manual labor" tasks that are procedural and don't require complex code context**, allowing you to focus on core analysis and code modification.

- **Core Division of Labor:**
  - **You (Schedule Agent):** You are responsible for all **file creation, deletion, and modification**. This is your primary duty, as you must maintain the complete code context and execution logic.
  - **`bg-worker`:** Responsible for executing auxiliary and operational tasks that do not directly modify core source code.

- **Suitable Task List for `bg-worker`:**
  - **Information Gathering:** Reading and summarizing key information from large documents, specifications, or logs.
  - **Git Operations:** Executing commands like `git status`, `git log`, `git diff` to get repository status, or even executing `git commit`.
  - **Simple Bash Operations:** Running commands like `grep`, `find`, `wc`, or executing test and build scripts.
  - **Data Extraction:** Parsing specific data from command outputs or files and formatting it for a report.

- **Instruction Examples:**
  - **(Excellent Instruction - Git Info Gathering)** "bg-worker, please execute the following:
    1.  Run `git log --oneline -n 10`.
    2.  From the output, identify all commit messages containing the keywords 'fix' or 'bug'.
    3.  Report back to me with a list of the corresponding commit hashes and messages."
  - **(Excellent Instruction - Doc Summary)** "bg-worker, read the file `API_V2_SPEC.md` and summarize all 'POST' type endpoint paths and their required request body parameters. Report the result to me as a Markdown list."
  - **(Incorrect Instruction)** "bg-worker, change the variable name foo to bar in a.js." (**Error! File modification must be performed by you, the Schedule Agent!**)

#### **Part 3: Task Governance & Parallelization Strategy**

##### **5. The Core Principle of Parallelization: Task Isolation**

Only consider parallelization when tasks are **completely independent**. Each sub-agent has its own isolated context. The concurrency limit is **2-3 tasks**.

##### **6. Task Breakdown and Concurrency Example**

**Scenario:** The ultimate goal is to safely refactor an old configuration variable, `LEGACY_API_HOST`, to `API_HOST` across the entire project.

**Example: Effective Task Breakdown and Role Assignment**

- **Step 1: Schedule Agent Reconnaissance**
  - You execute `ls -R` to get a high-level overview of the project structure, identifying key directories like `frontend/`, `backend/`, and `scripts/`.

- **Step 2: Parallel Information Gathering (`scout` Execution)**
  - **`scout-1` (Parallel):** "In the `frontend/` directory, search for all instances of `LEGACY_API_HOST`. Report the file path and line number for each occurrence."
  - **`scout-2` (Parallel):** "In the `backend/` directory, search for all instances of `LEGACY_API_HOST`. Report the file path and line number for each occurrence."

- **Step 3: Schedule Agent Synthesis & Planning**
  - Wait for both `scout-1` and `scout-2` to complete.
  - Synthesize their reports into a **complete checklist and a clear modification plan**, listing every file that needs to be changed.

- **Step 4: Schedule Agent Core Execution (File Modification)**
  - **You perform this step directly:** Iterate through the checklist generated in the previous step.
  - For each file in the list, **you personally** open it and replace `LEGACY_API_HOST` with `API_HOST`.

- **Step 5: `bg-worker` Verification & Wrap-up (Auxiliary Operation)**
  - After you have modified all the files, you can dispatch a `bg-worker` to verify the work and finalize the process.
  - **`bg-worker-1`:** "Please perform the following wrap-up operations:
    1.  Run `git status` to confirm that all modified files are accounted for.
    2.  Run the project's test suite (`npm run test` or equivalent) to ensure the refactor did not break any functionality.
    3.  If all tests pass, execute `git commit -m 'refactor(config): Rename LEGACY_API_HOST to API_HOST'`.
    4.  Report the output of all commands to me, especially noting whether the tests passed and if the git commit was successful."
